        Good Morning! New York!
    </h1>
    <p>
        I'm Daniel. I'm a student from Cornell University NYC campus. 
        Since that I'm living in New Jersey, therefore, 
        I'm going to show you how I get to school every day with rating from my view!

      <h2> First Approach: Traveling with Path to get to City</h2>
      <div class="rotating-3d">
      <img src="images/path.jpg" alt="My Photo" width="300" />
      </div>
      <article>
        <p>
          Overall rate: 3/5.  
          <strong>Pros:</strong> Cheap and give me more options while I was trying to rent an apartment  
          <strong>Cons:</strong> Slow! Takes about an hour to reach campus.  
          <em>Reddit says:</em> “We all know that PATH offers a cheap connection between New York and New Jersey, but I hate the fact that it's nowhere near as massive as the NYC Subway System.”

      <article>
        <p>
          Overall rate: 3.5/5.  
          <strong>Pros:</strong> Faster, Faster, Faster! So many good things happening on the Mahattan Island. 
          <strong>Cons:</strong> Always Maintenance for no reasons. Last time saw a guy poop in front of me 
          <em>Reddit says:</em> “Its fine overall. You may see some disgusting things now and then. Just keep your wits about you. Dont look like a distracted person staring at your phone the whole time. 
          .”

      <h2> Third Approach: Bus </h2>
      <div class="rotating-3d">
      <img src="images/bus.jpg" alt="My Photo" width="300" />
      </div>
      <article>
        <p>
          Overall rate: 4.5/5.  
          <strong>Pros:</strong> Cozy! None like path and subway sites.  
          <strong>Cons:</strong> Trafic on the bright. Since there's a over-the-bright fee just get involved, Things get easier.
          <em>Reddit says:</em> “I like the bus better than the train for sure. They have outlets to charge your phone, air conditioned and you can look out the window. I personally find it calming.”

      <h2>New HTML element "Video": War between ME and my CAT</h2>
      <iframe 
        src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v-12b-ZVQRSyPJ5mRCdveJBX26IRh637/preview"
        width="640"
        height="360"
        allow="autoplay">
      </iframe>
      <p>
        <strong>What I learned from Video:</strong> 
        The video element lets me play a playable video with built-in controls. I can set attributes like control, loop, autoplay. 
        If the browser doesn’t support the video, the fallback text is shown.
      </p>

    <section id="rotate-3d">
      <h2>New CSS element "rotateY"</h2>
      <p>
        I used transform: rotateY(180deg) along with a perspective property to create a 3D rotation effect.
        "GO TO ANY PICTURE!! IT WILL BE DIFFERENT".
        I believe this property wasn’t discussed in detail before, but it’s really powerful for interactive transformations.
