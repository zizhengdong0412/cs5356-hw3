      Good Morning! I'm Daniel, a student from the Cornell University NYC campus.
      I live in New Jersey, so I'm showing how I commute to school daily, 
      along with a brief rating from my perspective!

      <h2>First Approach: Traveling by PATH</h2>

      <article>
        <p>
          Overall rate: 3/5.  
          <strong>Pros:</strong> Cheap and give me more options while I was trying to rent an apartment  
          <strong>Cons:</strong> Slow! Takes about an hour to reach campus.  
          <em>Reddit says:</em> “We all know that PATH offers a cheap connection between New York and New Jersey, but I hate the fact that it's nowhere near as massive as the NYC Subway System.”

      <article>
        <p>
          Overall rate: 3.5/5.  
          <strong>Pros:</strong> Faster, Faster, Faster! So many good things happening on the Mahattan Island. 
          <strong>Cons:</strong> Always Maintenance for no reasons. Last time saw a guy poop in front of me 
          <em>Reddit says:</em> “Its fine overall. You may see some disgusting things now and then. Just keep your wits about you. Dont look like a distracted person staring at your phone the whole time. 
          .”

      <h4>Third Approach: Bus</h4>
      <img src="images/bus.jpg" alt="My Photo"/>
      <article>
        <p>
          Overall rate: 4.5/5.  
          <strong>Pros:</strong> Cozy! None like path and subway sites.  
          <strong>Cons:</strong> Trafic on the bright. Since there's a over-the-bright fee just get involved, Things get easier.
          <em>Reddit says:</em> “I like the bus better than the train for sure. They have outlets to charge your phone, air conditioned and you can look out the window. I personally find it calming.”

      <p>
        <strong>What I learned about Vedio:</strong> 
        The video element lets me play a playable video with built-in controls. I can set attributes like <code>controls</code>, 
        <code>autoplay</code>, <code>loop</code>, etc. 
        If the browser doesn’t support the video, the fallback text is shown.
