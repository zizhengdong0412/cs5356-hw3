        Good Morning! New York!
        I'm Daniel. I'm a student from Cornell University NYC campus. 
        Since that I'm living in New Jersey, therefore, 
        I'm going to show you how I get to school every day with rating from my view!

    <h2> First Approach: Traveling with Path to get to City</h2>
    <img src="images/path.jpg" alt="My Photo" width="300" />
    <article>
        <p>
          Overall rate: 3/5.  
          <strong>Pros:</strong> Cheap and give me more options while I was trying to rent an apartment  
          <strong>Cons:</strong> Slow! Takes about an hour to reach campus.  
          <em>Reddit says:</em> “We all know that PATH offers a cheap connection between New York and New Jersey, but I hate the fact that it's nowhere near as massive as the NYC Subway System.”

      <h3>Second Approach: NYC Subway</h3>
      <img src="images/subway.jpg" alt="My Photo" width="300"/>
      <article>
        <p>
          Overall rate: 3.5/5.  
          <strong>Pros:</strong> Faster, Faster, Faster! So many good things happening on the Mahattan Island. 
          <strong>Cons:</strong> Always Maintenance for no reasons. Last time saw a guy poop in front of me 
          <em>Reddit says:</em> “Its fine overall. You may see some disgusting things now and then. Just keep your wits about you. Dont look like a distracted person staring at your phone the whole time. 
          .”

      <h4> Third Approach: Bus </h4>
      <img src="images/bus.jpg" alt="My Photo" width="300" />
      <article>
        <p>
          Overall rate: 4.5/5.  
          <strong>Pros:</strong> Cozy! None like path and subway sites.  
          <strong>Cons:</strong> Trafic on the bright. Since there's a over-the-bright fee just get involved, Things get easier.
          <em>Reddit says:</em> “I like the bus better than the train for sure. They have outlets to charge your phone, air conditioned and you can look out the window. I personally find it calming.”

        <strong>What I learned about Vedio:</strong> 
        The video element lets me play a playable video with built-in controls. I can set attributes like control, loop, autoplay. 
        If the browser doesn’t support the video, the fallback text is shown.

        I used transform: rotateY(180deg) along with a perspective property to create a 3D rotation effect.
        I found that perspective determines how extreme the 3D effect looks.
        I believe this property wasn’t discussed in detail before, but it’s really powerful for interactive transformations.
