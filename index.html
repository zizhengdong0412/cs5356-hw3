        Good Morning!
        I'm Daniel. I'm a student from Cornell University NYC campus. 
        Since that I'm living in New Jersey, therefore, 
        I'm going to show you how I get to school every day with rating from my view!

    <article>
        <p>
          Overall rate: 3/5
          Pro and Cons from me: 
            P:Cheap and give me more options while I was trying to rent an apartment
            C: SLOW! SLOW! SLOW! Took me almost one hour normally to get to my school
          reddit:We all know that PATH offers a cheap connection between New York and New Jersey, but I hate the fact that it's nowhere near as massive as the NYC Subway System.

    <h3> Second Approach: NYC Subway </h3>

    <article>
        <p>
          Overall rate: 3.5/5
          Pro and Cons from me: 
            P: Faster, Faster, Faster! So many good things happening on the Mahattan Island.
            C: Always Maintenance for no reasons. Last time saw a guy poop in front of me
          reddit:Its fine overall. You may see some disgusting things now and then. Just keep your wits about you. Dont look like a distracted person staring at your phone the whole time.

      <h4> Third Approach: Bus </h4>
      <img src="images/bus.jpg" alt="My Photo" width="300" />
      <article>
          <p>
            Overall rate: 4.5/5
            Pro and Cons from me: 
              P: Cozy! None like path and subway sites.
              C: Trafic on the bright. Since there's a over-the-bright fee just get involved, Things get easier.
            reddit:I like the bus better than the train for sure. They have outlets to charge your phone, air conditioned and you can look out the window. I personally find it calming.
